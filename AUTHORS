The work was partially funded by both the Computation and Neural Systems
department and Kellogg Radiation Lab at Caltech, and in development use
was made of computers at Kellogg Lab.

Ofria and Travis Collier. Some additional contributions stem from
Claus O. Wilke.

The core avida system was designed by Chris Adami, C. Titus Brown, and

the 1993 Caltech SURF program, and the 1993 SUNY Stony Brook URECA program.
